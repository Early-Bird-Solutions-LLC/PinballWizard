# Decision log

Sub-ADR decisions for PinballWizard. Append-only. ADRs (in [`adr/`](adr/)) capture architectural decisions with significant trade-offs and alternatives. This log captures the smaller decisions: tool versions within a category, library choices, parameter values, naming conventions, threshold settings — anything worth retrieving later but too small to justify a full ADR.

Per [`guardrails.md`](guardrails.md) § "Decision log": format per entry is

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD — [Short title]
**Decision:** ...
**Alternatives considered:** ...
**Rationale:** ...
**Revisit when:** ...
**Related:** PR #XX, ADR-YYYY (if any)
```

Decisions reverse via a new entry that supersedes the prior one (with a back-reference); never edit history.

## When to add an entry vs. write an ADR

If **all four** of these are true, write an ADR (`adr/00NN-...md`) instead of a decision-log entry:

1. The decision has significant trade-offs.
2. Alternatives were genuinely considered (not default-accepted).
3. Consequences extend beyond the immediate PR.
4. Future readers (including future-Claude) would benefit from the permanent, formally-structured record.

Otherwise, this log is the right home.

## 2026-05-04 — Stern Playwright DTOs stay as classes, not records

**Decision:** `LinkRaw` (in `GamePageScraper`) and `BulletinRaw` (in `ServiceBulletinScraper`) — the DTO types Playwright deserializes `page.EvaluateAsync<T>()` results into — are `internal sealed class` with `[JsonPropertyName] public T Foo { get; set; }` properties. They are explicitly **not** positional records.

**Alternatives considered:**

- Positional records with `[property: JsonPropertyName(...)]` (PR #72's approach). Rejected: Playwright's `EvaluateArgumentValueConverter.ToExpectedType` calls `Activator.CreateInstance(t)` and walks properties — positional records have no parameterless ctor, so this throws `MissingMethodException` at runtime.
- Non-positional records with `init` setters. Rejected: Playwright's converter assigns properties via the setter at runtime, after the object already exists; `init` setters reject post-construction assignment.
- Custom `JsonConverter<T>` to force STJ deserialization. Rejected: Playwright's converter is hardcoded inside `EvaluateArgumentValueConverter` and does not consult STJ converters for typed deserialization.

**Rationale:** PR #72 reverted these to positional records on the assumption that Playwright 1.59 had switched to System.Text.Json. The post-merge live-site validation (Phase 2 § Scope item 6 hand-off, run 2026-05-04) surfaced the regression: `MissingMethodException: Cannot dynamically create an instance of type '…+BulletinRaw'. Reason: No parameterless constructor defined.` Stack trace pinpointed `EvaluateArgumentValueConverter.ToExpectedType`, confirming Playwright 1.59 still uses Activator-based deserialization (same as 1.12 from PR #34's original workaround). The PR #72 unit tests pinned STJ deserialization, which positional records satisfy — but Playwright never invokes STJ for typed `EvaluateAsync<T>` results. Tests pinned the wrong path.

**Revisit when:** A future Playwright release (post-1.59) genuinely switches to STJ-based deserialization for `EvaluateAsync<T>`. Indicator: source-link in the stack trace no longer references `EvaluateArgumentValueConverter`. Until then, this stays.

**Related:** PR #34 (original class workaround), PR #72 (failed records revert — superseded by this decision), PR currently open against this branch (this revert + Activator-based contract test). See also `tests/PinballWizard.Scraper.Tests/Scraping/Stern/SternPlaywrightDtoActivatorContractTests.cs` for the contract tests that now pin the actual Activator path.
